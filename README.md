# VigenereTools
> Simple tools that might help cracking Vigen√®re cipher

The scripts here presented may be used to crack Vigenere Cipher by providing you the key size used on the Ciphering process.
Please notice that `patterns.py` looks for patterns (on a specified interval of lengths) in the ciphered text. Which means that it may no be practical if the ciphered text is too big.
Nevertheless `IndexOfCoincidence.py` will work just fine for big texts. This method needs to know the Index of coincidence of the language's plaintext and the interval of probable key lengths.
